# CacheLibPy
An attempt to create a caching library in python from scratch in the hypothetical world with no Redis!! 

A basic attempt to the caching of a dictionary has been implemented. Which takes in the values of keys and updates if not found one and also deletes the oldest entry onto the cache to accommodate new keys
